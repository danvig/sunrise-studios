                    <p>
                        A graduate of Columbia University's prestigious film <br> program, Dave Greenfield won a Student Academy <br> Award in 1990 for his thesis 
                        project, Sleigh Ride. <br> Acclaim for the movie landed Dave an agent at CAA <br> and a deal at Columbia Pictures, where he developed <br> 
                        several projects. Although none made it to the silver <br> screen, Dave's obvious talents behind-the-wheel at <br> UPS (as well as his 
                        keen creative intellect) caught the <br> attention of Sunrise's own Don Crosby, who hired the <br> young man to head Sunrise's 
                        transportation <br> department. Dave was recently married to Sarah <br> Blum, his therapist. Congratulations, Dave!
