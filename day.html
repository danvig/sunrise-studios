                        Sandy comes to Sunrise with an extensive and <br> impressive background in the Theater. Trained as a <br> dancer and stage actor at Julliard, he 
                        went on to <br> perform with several highly- acclaimed New York <br> Dance Repertoires. His performing career culminated <br> with his role as the 
                        Swan in the Boston Classic Dance <br> Troop's worldwide tour of the "Ugly Duckling." Sandy <br> walked away from this career when his twin brother, <br> 
                        also an acclaimed dancer, died tragically while on tour <br> in Russia. The dance world's loss was Hollywood's <br> gain. Mr. Day came to Sunrise 
                        after working two years <br> for Richard Simmons' Productions. He ascended the <br> production ranks here rather quickly as a Coordinator, <br>
                        Production Manager, Line Producer and a Post-<br>Production Coordinator under Arnie Reisner. He is now <br>in charge of our day-to-day 
                        production.
