                        A native of New Orleans, Virginia majored in occult <br> studies at Tulane University and worked part-time as a <br> fourth-grade teacher. 
                        In 1972, Virginia moved to Los <br> Angeles with her boyfriend, actor Paul Drake (Who <br> Said That?,) and landed an internship at the 
                        newly <br> formed studio. She has been with the Studio for over <br> twenty-seven years, working in such capacities as <br> Story Editor, 
                        Associate Producer (Frankenpimp, The <br> Butcher, The Baker, The Candlestick Killer, Dr. Jugular), Executive Story Editor, 
                        <br> Development Executive, Junior Director of <br> Development, Director of Development, and Creative Executive. No trip to <br> Sunrise 
                        is complete without a visit to Virginia's office <br> and a close inspection of her wide collection of voodoo <br> dolls.
