                    <p>
                        Mr. Reisner has a long, distinguished history in this <br> town. At sixteen, he graduated from Westlake High <br> School in 
                        Thousand Oaks and went to work in the <br> Sunrise mailroom. From there, he went on to PA, AD, <br> and Coordinate on 
                        numerous Sunrise hits. He even <br> played extra roles in Opium Den, Tailpipe, and Is <br> Somebody There? In 1975, Arnie left 
                        Sunrise to focus <br> on family matters. He took a job with world giant <br> Global Bank for twelve years before finally leaving 
                        a <br> Vice President position to return to Hollywood. Mr. <br> Crosby welcomed Arnie back to the studio with open <br> arms. 
                        Mr. Reisner went to work in the post department <br> and supervised such hits as Dr. Jugular, Erotic Illusion, <br> and Ice 
                        Scream Truck before taking over the division <br> in 1994.
