                        Nobody has more frequent flier miles than Heather <br> Rice, our executive responsible for buying the latest <br> films and ensuring 
                        Sunrise projects are shown in the <br> best venues. Heather got her start at Drive-In <br> Entertainment, a small distribution company 
                        in the <br> Midwest in 1982 before being introduced to Don <br> Crosby at ShoWest in 1984. By 1985, Heather was <br> working for Sunrise, 
                        searching the globe for pictures <br> like We're Gonna Take a Ride and Goin' Postal. In fact, <br> it was Heather's eye for talent 
                        that discovered young <br> black director Lionel Washington and his comedy <br> Gimme Some! at the Song & Dance Film Festival in 
                        <br> Boise. Heather continues to be the company's #1 <br> schmoozer and we look forward to many more years <br> with her.
