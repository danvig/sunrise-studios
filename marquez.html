                        Roberta enjoyed an education in Art History at Harbor <br> Community College and UCLA. She went on to earn an <br> MFA from Boston's School of 
                        Fine Arts in 1989 as an <br> acclaimed sculptor. After five years in Aspen, Colorado, <br> where she received tremendous commercial 
                        success, <br> great media response, and several retrospectives <br> around the globe, Roberta was forced to retire from <br> the art world 
                        due to a freak accident involving a <br> kitchen knife. Never one to be discouraged by the <br> hand dealt her, Marquez moved to 
                        Los Angeles and ran <br> the administration of the small private arts & sciences <br> school, Crossroads. In 1997, she took a job 
                        under <br> former Sunrise Administration head, Claire Redbound. <br> When our old friend retired, Roberta took over and has <br> made 
                        sure that the studio has been running smoothly <br> ever since.
