                        A cousin of former Sunrise hunk Alan Texas, Lynn <br> started in the business at the early age of fourteen <br> when she appeared in 
                        several teenage horror pics. At <br> seventeen, she went on to land the title role of Annie <br> in the Bohica Studios erotic 
                        thriller Psycho Sexual. <br> When Lynn hit twenty, she desired a career and <br> lifestyle change and enrolled in the Don Gordon 
                        <br> Memorial Rehabilitation Program. She graduated from <br> the center at the top of her class and was placed in Mr. <br> Crosby's 
                        office. After six months as an intern, McKay <br> ascended into the role of Mr. Crosby's second <br> assistant. Finally this fall, 
                        Lynn took on her current <br> full-time post. Keep it up Lynn, we're all so proud.
