                        Gwen comes to Sunrise with a wonderful "people <br> oriented" background. A graduate of Lehigh University, <br> Gwen went to work for the
                        basketball program at <br> University of Arizona. There, she tutored players and <br> handled their day-to-day schedules. She went on 
                        <br> marry Wildcat pointguard and future NBA all-star Sly <br> Trabar. When he moved to the NBA, she took on the <br> role of his agent. 
                        After two years as the league's only <br> female agent, Gwen was forced to leave the NBA in a <br> cloud of controversy involving 
                        Trabar's suspended jail <br> sentence for the money laundering charges against <br> alleged drug dealer Alvin "Little Man" King. In 
                        1985, <br> Moran went to work for the Pittsburgh based Flash <br> Cochran Cutlery Company as the head of personnel. <br> After nine fulfilling 
                        years at the knife company, Gwen <br> took her current job with the studio.
