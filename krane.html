                        As Don Crosby explains, "it never hurts to have <br> someone from M.I.T. on the team." Dubbed the "mad <br> scientist" by his colleagues, Ira 
                        is responsible for <br> negotiating and overseeing projects beyond our <br> American borders. Arnie's career shifted from physics <br> to film 
                        when he was hired as a consultant on The Right <br> Stuff and he worked as several major studios before <br> finding a home at Sunrise. 
                        Arnie credits his fluency in <br> eleven languages and ability to memorize currency <br> exchange rates to his top-secret work with the 
                        United <br> States Government during the Cold War.
