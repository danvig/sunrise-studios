                        A twenty-year veteran of India's film industry, Karim <br> made the move from Bollywood to Hollywood in 1995 <br> and was 
                        hired last year to run the Sunrise lot for <br> twenty times the salary he received in Bombay. Karim <br> started working 
                        in the entertainment industry when he <br> was just four years old, an orphan who was hired to <br> hold an umbrella over 
                        an Indian movie star for a shoot <br> during the Monsoon season. After two years, he was <br> promoted to "snack boy", a 
                        position that exposed <br> Karim to the inner workings of a movie studio. He <br> toiled on over 400 musicals in India before 
                        saving up <br> enough money to come to America.
