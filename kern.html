                        At twenty-nine, James is one of the youngest people <br> ever to run the day-to-day operations of a major <br> studio. He comes to us 
                        by-way of Middlebury College, <br> where he graduated Magna-Cum-Laude and starred on <br> the school's nationally ranked ultimate 
                        frisbee team. <br> After a year racing off-road vehicles, he turned to the <br> film industry. James produced over thirty music 
                        videos <br> and industrials for the LA based Urbanos Milagros <br> Productions. In 1996, he took a job with Dick Clark <br> Productions 
                        and was soon at the helm of the day-to-<br>day production. In 1998, he accepted an offer to join <br> the Sunrise family in his 
                        current capacity. James still <br> keeps his hand in the music business as he has just <br> Executive Produced an album by urban 
                        artist Shoshoni <br> entitled Ghost Dance. Look for it at your local record <br> store!
