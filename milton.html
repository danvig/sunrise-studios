                        The son of a bus driver and a grammar school teacher, <br> John Milton worked in the mailroom at United Artists <br> before becoming an assistant 
                        for producing legend <br> Benjamin E. Stokely. After his mentor passed away in <br> 1967, Milton teamed up with the one and only Fred <br> Rifkin 
                        to create Is Somebody There? and The Path to <br> Gold. (The latter was actually financed in 1969 <br> when Milton, at a Sunrise Christmas 
                        party, bet Don Gordon <br> he could make the film in nine days for a mere <br> $35,000.) Milton's producing ingenuity, when matched <br> with 
                        Fred Rifkin's talents, is a collaboration that has <br> entertained millions over the past three decades. <br> Despite occassional "breaks" 
                        from the business, <br> Milton's prolific career has spawned numerous hits, <br> including Is Somebody There?, Who Said That?, 
                        Space <br> Psycho, Frankenpimp, and, of course, The Stab <br> Trilogy. As a result, Mr. Milton's beautiful home in the <br> Hollywood Hills 
                        houses one of the best collections of <br> horror movie props in the world. While Milton is the <br> first to admit his life has been full 
                        of ups and downs, <br> this Hollywood survivor is currently enjoying the peak <br> of his career.
