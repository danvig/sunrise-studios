                        Mr. Birch has been a member of the Sunrise family <br> from the very beginning. He actually began his <br> Hollywood career with a bit part as a 
                        grade school <br> bully on Leave It To Beaver before turning his <br> attention to a role behind the camera. After working <br>as an assistant director 
                        on dozens of Hollywood films <br> (including Here Comes The Brideand Maggie) Bill was <br> chosen to direct Mr. Crosby's and Mr. Gordon's very <br> first 
                        film, It Walked From the Waves. Mr. Birch went on <br> to direct The Creature with Seven Armsand Where Are <br> You, Doc Holiday? before his 
                        no-nonsense approach to <br> filmmaking caught the attention of Paramount <br> Pictures. At Paramount, Mr. Birch directed the thriller <br> Asylum 
                        and eventually stepped into producing as he <br> oversaw three dozen films, including Octopus and the <br> romantic comedy hit First Date. 
                        Mr. Birch returned to <br> his "Sunrise roots" as President in 1996 and the <br> Studios' continued success is due in great part to Mr. Birch's 
                        <br> strong leadership.
