                        Floyd got his start as a young screenwriter after a <br> brief stint at USC, where he majored in zoology. While <br> working as a freelance 
                        script reader at Paramount, his <br> first script, about a demented zookeeper, was optioned <br> by Don Gordon. Subsequently, the Two 
                        Dons hired to <br> write The Creature With Seven Armsand Where Are <br> You, Doc Holiday? In 1962, he married Sunrise starlet 
                        <br> Danielle Rangler and Floyd went on to scribe several <br> more screenplays for various studios. With three <br> handsome sons 
                        to feed, Floyd later put down the pen <br> and focused his efforts on producing as a development <br> executive at Universal. 
                        In 1973, he rejoined the Two <br> Dons as Vice President of Production and went on to <br> greenlight such hits as Deathworld, 
                        Don't Go <br> Downstairs Again, and cult classic Bloodthirsty <br> Vampires From Deep Outer Space.
