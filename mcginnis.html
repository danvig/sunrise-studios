                        Much of the pristine Sunrise lot's beauty is due to the <br> hard work of Ralph McGinnis and his maintenance <br> crew. Ralph came 
                        to Sunrise Studios through the "Fifth <br> Chance" program, sponsored by the L.A. County <br> Mental Health Society, designed 
                        to give patients at <br> local sanitariums a chance at a normal life. Ralph <br> spent ten years at the Shady Hills Home, 
                        where he <br> had plenty of time to study horticulture and develop <br> valuable custodial skills. Ralph's checkered past has 
                        <br> also been an asset to the Studio, as he has been a <br> technical consultant on several films, including First <br> House on 
                        the Right and I Peel Off Your Skin, and the <br> schizophrenic classic Who Said That?.
