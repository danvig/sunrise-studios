                        Though many consider the chief of Sunrise Studios to <br> have been born with Hollywood in his blood, Mr. <br> Crosby actually grew up on the rolling hills of Marin <br> County in Northern 
                        California. Even more surprising, <br> Mr. Crosby initially dreamed of becoming a banker, and <br> even studied business at the University of California, <br>
                        Los Angeles. His fate changed, however, when he met <br> Don Gordon in 1959, and the rest is history. Mr. <br> Crosby's talents as a businessman contributed 
                        to the <br> success of the duo's first film, It Walked From The <br> Waves, and to the eventual creation of the studio we <br> now know as Sunrise. As a young man, 
                        Mr. Crosby's <br> savvy fundraising skills and inventive production <br> methods allowed the prolific studio to create an <br> average of fifteen films per year. 
                        Today, Don Crosby is <br> one of the most respected men in Hollywood as the <br> founder and president of the industry's most profitable <br> studio. Mr. Crosby's 
                        future goals include winning an <br> Academy Award and spending more time with his three <br> beautiful grandchildren at his Marin County <br> ranch, 
                        Blackie's Place.
