                        The story of Mr. Slate is one of the more inspirational <br> on the Sunrise backlot. Tony lost his hearing, as well <br> as three fingers, 
                        working as a woodshop teacher in <br> several Los Angeles public high schools. Without his <br> fingers, sign language was a near 
                        impossibility, but <br> that did not stop the determined teacher from landing <br> a carpenter job on the set of Don't Go Downstairs.<br> 
                        From that point on, the sets and scenery for many of <br>Sunrise's best known films came from Tony Slate's <br> woodshop, located behind 
                        Stage 7 under the shadow <br> of the Sunrise parking garage. Because of our <br> constant production schedule, Tony's shop is always <br> 
                        buzzing with the sounds of skill saws, jigsaws, <br> sanders, and drills.
