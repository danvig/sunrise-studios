                        Sometimes it seems like Will <br> Kennison was born into a movie of <br> his own. After surviving a near-fatal <br> fall from a tree as a child, 
                        Will spent <br> the remainder of his adolescence <br> recovering in a head trauma center. <br> There he met Dr. Alice Ehlers, the <br> 
                        screenwriter of the drama Who Said <br> That?,who trained Will in the craft <br> and sent him to Hollywood at the <br> age of eighteen. 
                        Five years later, <br> Will sold his first spec script, the <br> twisted Real Estate Agent of <br> Death to Sunrise Studios. He gained <br> 
                        national attention for his witty style <br> of gore soon after with his smash <br> hit Stab. Today, Will is one of <br> Hollywood's hottest 
                        writers, the <br> scribe of nearly one dozen feature <br> films in addition to his hit teen <br> television drama Young Spielbergs.
