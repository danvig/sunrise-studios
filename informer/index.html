            ollywood horror legend Fred Rifkin is out, hot <br> young music vid helmer Roman Bridger is in as <br> director of the 
            much anticipated Stab 3. The <br> decision, made by producer John Milton yesterday, marks <br> the end of a rocky first 
            two weeks of preproduction. <br> Citing "creative differences," Milton told reporters that he <br> and Fred "were 
            not seeing the same picture." Milton had <br> "no choice" but to replace the aging vet with "somebody <br> young, 
            hip and fresh, somebody like Roman Bridger." <br> Bridger recently picked up an MTV Video Music Award <br> for his 
            psychedelic beach party video "Hoochie Chase" by <br> the Booty Bruthas.

            While Rifkin was unavailable for comment, insiders say <br> the meeting yesterday was as scary as some of the <br> director's movies. 
            Sources report hearing a series of <br> screamed threats, including "Somebody will pay for this!", and several golf carts were 
            later <br> discovered overturned. A billboard for Stab 3 was also defaced. While many would argue <br> the success of the Stab series 
            is largely due to the talents of Mr. Rifkin, his tantrum at the <br> lot left many studio employees feeling puzzled and nervous. 
            "I'm gonna watch my back for <br> the next couple days," said D-girl Helen Combs.

            <br><br>
            Mr. Bridger, lunching at the Ivy with superagent Beverly Choi, seemed thrilled by the <br> studio's decision: "When I was a kid, Fred's movies 
            gave me nightmares all the time. It's an <br> honor to replace him."
