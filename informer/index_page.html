            unrise Studios has pulled the third and final knife <br> from the "Stab" drawer, according to industry <br> insiders. Sources say hot 
            teen horror scribe Will <br> Kennison dropped off a script for the series' last installment <br> (predictably titled "Stab 3") on Monday 
            AM and chief Don <br> Crosby was packaging the film by lunch.

            The tight-lipped Crosby would only offer that <br> "Stab 3" is "going to be the best 'Stab' yet," and <br> "Stab" producer John Milton was unusually quiet: <br>
            "Will has outdone himself on the first draft and has <br> a great surprise ending fans will love. I plan to <br> keep it that way."

            Tori Spelling has no comment yet on whether she will be returning to the role of Sidney, <br> but Fred Rifkin is rumored to be on board to direct the 
            final chapter. Industry vultures are <br> already buzzing above the Sunrise lot, hoping to get their up-and-coming teen stars signed <br> up with the 
            franchise. Casting begins officially in a few weeks. The "Stab" franchise is <br> based on the best selling books, "The Woodsboro Murders" and 
            "The Windsor Murders", <br> by Gale Weathers. -Sara Maslin</div>

                        ollywood is <br> cyberbuzzing this week <br> after Sunrise Studios <br> prexy Don Crosby announced <br> the mini-major's internet debut, <br> skedded for the 
                        fourth week of <br> November. While many <br> industryites are quick to dismiss Sunrise's legitimacy, Crosby remains as confident as ever: 
                        "Sunrise has always been a pioneer in new media and our website will not disappoint." <br><br> The studio chief, who built Sunrise with 
                        late maverick <br> producer Don Gordon, is certain the new site will satisfy <br> Sunrise's cult fans as well as make new friends with <br> 
                        websurfers unfamiliar with the Sunrise label. "The site will <br> be interactive," Crosby explained, "giving movie fans a <br> chance to 
                        see the ins and outs of a movie studio like never <br> before." <br><br> Insiders say timing is just right for the studio, which <br> plans to 
                        promote "Stab 3" heavily on the new site. Prez Bill <br> Birch promises "Stab" fans a web premiere of the "Stab 3" <br> trailer later 
                        this month. "It's going to be our scariest movie <br> yet. Next time you log on, take a 'Stab' at our site." - Art <br> Canby

                        elevision news personality Gale Weathers inked a deal last week to be the new host of "Total Entertainment." Ms. Weathers is best known 
                        for her relentless reporting and subsequent novels on the notorious Woodsboro murders as well as for her ability to take a punch. 
                        However, insiders say her stormy track record prevented the ambitious reporter from landing a coveted gig on an unidentified top-rated 
                        newsmag. Skies darkened last month when Sunrise Studios TV department left Weathers out in the cold and canceled her show "Top Story." 
                        Weathers, a self-proclaimed "survivor," declared the "Total" deal "mutually beneficial for the network, myself, and the world in general." 
                        In addition to the show, Weathers says its high tide for her own website, www.galeweathers.com. Fans of the "Weather" channel will have 
                        to wait a few more weeks, however. The site is scheduled to blow into e-town November 22nd. - Jason Voorjes

                        usty Penn ("Stab 2"), set to bow this weekend in "Gleason's: Life on the Ropes," has backed out of a deal to star in and produce the 
                        drama "Spin Doctor" for Vanguard Pictures. The dust has not yet settled and Penn's reasons for the sudden decision remain unclear.

                        The studio paid a high sum for the rights to the novel by Christopher B. Shields and was hoping for a marquee name to go with the 
                        on-the-run fable. Penn was that actor until today. "Obviously, we're very disappointed."
